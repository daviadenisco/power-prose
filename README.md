Power Prose


Power Prose is a web application that uses speech-to-text and tone analysis technology to help women decrease their use of qualifying words and phrases, which can demean their authority and diminish their contributions. Through Power Prose, women can choose a set of “watch words” they want to decrease their use of -- words and phrases like “just,” “sorry”, “I was just wondering,” “I’m no expert,” and more. The Power Prose platform allows women to record their speech during a variety of situations such as business calls, meetings, presentations, and more, and leverages the power of IBM’s watson speech and text analysis to provide analysis of those conversations and actionable insights to decrease their use of tentative speech and increase their clout, confidence, and contributions.

This project was inspired by a shared vision among group members to produce a platform to support women professionally.
This project leverages IBM watson speech to text and tone analysis technology to allow women to record their speech in business interactions such as phone calls, meetings, presentations, and more, and to receive immediate analysis of the qualifying words and phrases they used during those interactions, as well as of the sentences they used that were likely perceived as “tentative.”
